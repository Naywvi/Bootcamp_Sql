### Welcome!

Welcome to the SQL Pool. The idea of this pool is to introduce you to SQL by manipulating a database.

You need to have a repository to push you `.sql` file,
first of all create a repository named `((ROOT))`.
You need to put your SQL query in a specific file name, you can see the file to submit above.

Follow the instructions to download the database and how to use the database to make query.

Good luck !

**For each exercise, if you need to modify the database (with an `UPDATE` / `INSERT` / `CREATE`... query), you must download again the database to have the good version.**

[Download the database](https://github.com/thomaslenaour/ytrack/blob/main/sql/tests/db/chinook.db)

### Installation

In order to realize SQL Query, you need to download the database [here](https://github.com/thomaslenaour/ytrack/blob/main/sql/tests/db/chinook.db).

⚠️ For Linux user, process is almost the same, but screenshot may differ a little.

Once the database is download, you can download software such as [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) for example to perform your SQL queries.

When TablePlus is launched, you need to make a new connection and select SQLite :
