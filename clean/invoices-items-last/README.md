## invoices-items-last

### Instructions

Imagine that you have a dashboard where you can access the latest products that were purchased during the last invoice. This is a frequent occurrence and the last products purchased will change with each new invoice.

There are SQL subqueries to resolve this problem. The idea is to make a request in a request.

Select the `Name` of the products purchased on the last invoice using a subquery.
