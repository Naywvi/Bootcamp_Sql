## concat-employee

### Instructions

You must concatenate several columns between them. To do this, get the `FirstName`,` LastName` and `City` information of all employees with the alias` Employee`, all concatenated like the example below.

`[FIRST_NAME] [LAST_NAME] lives in [CITY]`

Exemple :

`Calvin Sea Phanh lives in Bordeaux`

Be careful with the TabePlus autocompletion, you can't use `"`.
