## genre-tracks-average

### Instructions

In order to have statistics, you have to calculate the average time of the `tracks` of each `genre`.

To do this, write a query that will retrieve:

- the genre `Name`
- Alias `AverageDuration` which represents the average duration of all tracks associated with the genre

You must order results by `AverageDuration` in descending order.
